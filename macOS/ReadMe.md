# ReadMe for VeraCrypt command line on macOS

## Overview

This folder contains shell scripts you can use as a template for writing your own scripts to control VeraCrypt. You'll find the blog post that describes these files at [https://arcanecode.com/2021/06/07/3504/](https://arcanecode.com/2021/06/07/3504/). Alteratively, a copy has been placed in the [post.md](post.md) file in this folder.

Each script is well documented with all of its parameters. When doing a code review, I'd suggest reading in this order:

1. create-volume.sh
1. mount-volume.sh
1. list-volumes.sh
1. dismount-volume.sh

There is one other file, randomdata.txt, that is used in the create-volume.sh script. It's just a bunch of random letters and numbers that VeraCrypt will use in the hashing process. It was generated by closing my eyes and smacking myself in the head with the keyboard a few dozen times.
