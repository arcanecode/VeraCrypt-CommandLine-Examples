# VeraCrypt-CommandLine-Examples

## Overview

The files in this project are to support a series of blog posts on [https://arcanecode.com](https://arcanecode.com). You can visit the individual posts (links below) for full explanations, or look through the comments in the various shell scripts.

Specifically, they are examples of using VeraCrypt from the command line of various operating systems to create, mount, and dismount VeraCrypt encrypted volumes. Examples are provided for macOS, Windows, and Linux (Ubuntu, although should work on most distros).

Please note the examples cover the basics of VeraCrypt. More advanced topics such as hidden volumes are not covered here, although my post at [Creating and Using Hidden Containers in VeraCrypt](https://arcanecode.com/2021/05/31/creating-and-using-hidden-containers-in-veracrypt/) describes how to use them from the GUI.
